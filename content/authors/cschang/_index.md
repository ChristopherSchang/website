I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, working at the chair of Macroeconomics with <a href="https://johannesbrumm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Johannes Brumm</a>.

I hold a PhD in Economics from the European University Institute. My thesis advisors were <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/coopereconomics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Russell Cooper</a> and <a href="https://alexandermonge.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Alexander Monge-Naranjo</a>. Previously, I was a Research Analyst at DG-International at the European Central Bank.

My Research focuses on Quantitative Macroeconomics with Heterogenous Agents and I am interested in topics related to Household Finance, Demographics, Housing and Monetary Economics.
